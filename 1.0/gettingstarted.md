# Getting started with nextjs 🙏🏻
To get started with Next.js, you'll need the following requirements: 

- [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en) which is the actual language without this you cannot run the app and cannot install next.js
- **npm or Yarn**: These are package managers that come with Node.js.

## resources:

[what is eslint](https://github.com/xxpwnxxx420lord/nextjs-notes/blob/main/1.0/eslint.md)

To create a application with nextjs you need to open your terminal which can be accessed by just searching up terminal in windows search system and typing/pasting the following code in.

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

After entering this command, the terminal will display: 

```bash
what is your project named >> input: str
```

Enter your desired project name in the space provided. For example, I'm naming my project 'next-js-notes'.

after that happens it will ask you if you want your project to use ‘typescript’ (typescript is a really good coding language, if you know js it will be easy) for this guide, I **will** use typescript because I find it easier to use.

To ensure you're following along correctly and to minimize any potential issues or misunderstandings, I recommend carefully matching the tools, configurations, and settings demonstrated in my examples. This will help you achieve consistent results and make it easier to troubleshoot if you encounter any difficulties during the setup and development process.

then navigate to the folder by using; on the terminal

```bash
cd projectname
```

and to run your app you need to paste in the terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```
